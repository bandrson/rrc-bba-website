                        This project collects and analyzes data from the solar panel array located on the exterior of the Princess Building. Currently, the data from the panels is collected and analyzed by a laptop running a piece of specialized software. This data is then displayed on one of the televisions located on the 4th floor of the Princess building. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.rrc.ca/informationsystems/2015/11/30/solar-panel-technology-corner/">Solar Panel Technology Corner</a>.

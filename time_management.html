          <br>
          <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
          <h4>You've got the time ✔</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Know exactly what you want.</b> State your wants as clear, specific goals. And put them in writing.</li>
            <li><b>Know how to get what you want.</b> Take action to meet your goals. Determine what you’ll do today to get what you want in the future. Put those actions into writing.</li>
            <li><b>Go for balance.</b> When we lack balance in our lives, we spend most of our time dealing with interruptions, last minute projects and emergencies.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
          <h4>Setting and achieving goals ✔</h4>
          <p><b>Write specific goals.</b></p>
          <p>State your goals as observable actions or measurable results.</p>
          <p>Example: Goal is to become a better student.</p>
          <p>What actions should you take to become one?</p>
          <p>"Study two hours for every hour I’m in class."</p>
          <p>There’s a difference between a vague goal(Get a good education) vs a specific goal(Get a degree in engineering with honors by 2022).</p>
          <p><b>Write goals in several Time frames.</b></p>
          <p><b>Long Term goals </b>represent major targets in your life. Can take 5 to 20 years to achieve. Education, careers, personal relationships, travel and financial security.</p>
          <p><b>Mid Term goals</b> are objectives you want to accomplish within 1 to 5 years. Course of study, car loan or a specific career level.</p>
          <p><b>Short Term </b>goals you can do within a year. Things like completing a hiking trail or organizing a family reunion.</p>
          <br>
          <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
          <h4>Write goals in several areas of life ✔</h4>
          <p>Having goals in only one area of life can be lop sided and stunt personal goals. Set goals in a variety of categories like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Education</b></li>
            <li><b>Career</b></li>
            <li><b>Financial life</b></li>
            <li><b>Family life or relationships</b></li>
            <li><b>Social life</b></li>
            <li><b>Spiritual life</b></li>
            <li><b>Level of health</b></li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
          <h4>Reflect on your goals ✔</h4>
          <p>Every week you should think about your goals. These are examples of spot checks:</p>
          <p><b>Check in with your feelings.</b></p>
          <p>Remember how the process of setting goals felt. Remember the satisfaction you’ll gain by completing your objectives.</p>
          <p><b>Check for alignment.</b></p>
          <p>Find the connection between goals. Do your short-term goals align with your mid term goals? Will your mid term goals lead to achieving long term goals?</p>
          <p><b>Check for obstacles.</b></p>
          <p>Things that keep you from achieving your goals. Find work around solutions.</p>
          <p><b>Check for immediate steps.</b></p>
          <p>Make a list of small achievable steps to accomplish each of your short term goals. Put them on a to-do list, accomplish by a certain date and put it on a calendar you consult daily.</p>
          <br>
          <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
          <h4>Be SMART about your goals ✔</h4>
          <p><b>Clarity in setting goals.</b></p>
          <p>Important for being specific, measurable and time bound. For goals to be relevant they need to be sufficiently challenging and rewarding.</p>
          <p><b>Feedback.</b></p>
          <p>Allows you to clarify any uncertainties along the way and make adjustments where necessary.</p>
          <br>
          <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
          <h4>The ABC daily to-do list ✔</h4>
          <p>Its easy to forget your daily tasks during a busy day. Writing them down makes it so you don’t have to remember what to do next.</p>
          <p><b>How to make a to do list</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Brainstorm Tasks.</b> Write down all the things you want to get done during the day.</li>
            <li><b>Estimate time.</b> How long will it take to complete these tasks? Less time feels rushed and more time feels less productive. Add up all the estimated time it will take to do all tasks. Also add up all your unscheduled hours you have during the day. Compare and see if its reasonable.</li>
            <li><b>Rate each task by priority.</b> Prevents overscheduling. The things on the top of your list should be the most critical.</li>
            <li><b>Cross off tasks.</b>Crossing off activities when you finish them and writing down more when you think of them.</li>
            <li><b>Evaluate.</b> At the end of the day, evaluate your performance. Look at the tasks you didn’t get done. When you’re done evaluating, start on the next days to-do list.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>

          <h4>Stop procrastination NOW ✔</h4>
          <p>You have to choose to stop procrastinating, It’s a simple choice but people make it complicated.</p>
          <p><b>Discover the costs.</b></p>
          <p>Find out if procrastination is keeping you from getting what you want.</p>
          <p><b>Discover your procrastination style.</b></p>
          <p>Psychologist Linda Sapadin identifies different styles of procrastination.</p>
          <p><em>Dreamers:</em>Have big goals that they seldom translate into specific plans.</p>
          <p><em>Worriers:</em>focus on the worst-case scenario. People talk about their problems rather than solving them.</p>
          <p><em>Defiers:</em>Resist new tasks. They promise to do things and never do them.</p>
          <p><em>Overdoers:</em>Create extra work for themselves by refusing to delegate tasks and neglect priorities.</p>
          <p><em>Perfectionist:</em>put off tasks for fear of making a mistake.</p>
          <p>Find your stle and adjust according to your behavior.</p>
          <p><b>Trick yourself into getting started. </b></p>
          <p>You have a 50-page chapter to read? Tell yourself you’ll just flip through the pages for 10 minutes. Things like this help you do things you’ve been dreading.</p>
          <p><b>Let feelings follow action.</b></p>
          <p>Things like waiting until you have the energy to exercise will lead to you holding it off your weeks or months. Start slow like brisk walking and see how fast your feelings change.</p>
          <p><b>Choose to work under pressure.</b></p>
          <p>Put yourself in control and work with a due date. Plan a big block of time right before a deadline and do it during the preceding week.</p>
          <p><b>Think ahead. </b></p>
          <p>Use a long-term planner to list due dates for all your assignments. Anticipate heavy demands of your time and take action to prevent last minute crunches.</p>
          <p><b>Giving up “someday”. </b></p>
          <p>Procrastination rests on this vague notion. Life start when…(fill in the blank like graduate from college). Let go of this logic and act today.</p>
          <p><b>Create goals that draw you forward. </b></p>
          <p>A goal that pulls your heartstrings will pull you forward. Set goals that excite you. You should discover that procrastination is part of your past.</p>

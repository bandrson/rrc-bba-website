          <h3>Have a runbook idea to add?</h3>
          <p>The purpose of these runbooks is to help future students with common problems that may not be covered soon enough
          or at all, in their courses. These are student developed and written. So, if you have an idea, here is the process to get your
          runbook added:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/bits-and-bytes-association/rrc-bba-website" target="_blank">Fork the BBA Repo to your github account</a> by <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github" target="_blank">these instructions</a></li>
            <li>Create a new HTML doc for your runbook, prefixed with runbook. i.e "runbook_how_to_github.html"</li>
            <li>Copy the code from the _outline_template.html over to your new runbook file (this ensures consistent look, headers, and footers)</li>
            <li>Write the runbook in the section where it says "put your content here"</li>
            <li>After you have finished, add your runbook to the runbook navbar link (Found in the header.html)</li>
            <li>Open a pull request for the BBA to approve!</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If you are unsure if a subject is appropriate for a runbook or not, please feel free to reach out in our Discord and ask us! I promise we are friendly.</p>

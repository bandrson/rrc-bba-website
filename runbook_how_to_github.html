            <h3>TL:DR</h3>
              <div>
                <p>This is the short version of this document. When I learned how to use github initially, I only used a handful of commands. Git Pull/Clone to get the repo I wanted
                to work on. "Git checkout -b" to create a place I can safely make changes, and then after I was done, in this order, "Git Add .", "Git Commit -m 'message'", "git push origin branch-name"
                I would then follow the link provided in my console output to open a pull request to have someone approve the changes. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>to create a git repo - "git init"</li>
                  <li>Create a new branch - "git checkout -b [branch-name]</li>
                  <li>Pull the lastest verison on the origin - "git pull"
                </ul>
                <p> Saving changes
                <ul>
                  <li>Stage Changes - "git add ."</li>
                  <li>Commit Changes - "git commit -m 'message-of-what-changed'"
                  <li>Save the changes on github - "git push origin 'branch-name-changes-are-on'"
                </ul>
              </div>
              <h3>So, you want to use GitHub</h3>
              <div>
                <p>Have you ever used CTRL-Z to undo a change you’ve made in a file? Have you ever wanted to undo a change you made a while ago? Thats exactly what
                git is for! Well, one of the things. Modern programming using version control for a number of reasons</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Work on new projects features while at the same time patching bugs found in older version of the code.</li>
                  <li>Collaborate with someone on a projects without overwriting each other’s work.</li>
                  <li>Work with distributed teams of coders from around the world to develop open-source applications.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h5>A Quick Note</h5>
                <p> There are a number of git and github UI's out there, such as GitKracken, or just the GitHub Desktop app. However, this runbook will focus on
                using git via the command line. But we wanted to give you a heads up that those other tools are out there as well</p>

                <h3>So, what is git?</h3>
                <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. Git helps us keep track of the changes to our source code over the lifespan of a project.
                Just in case I don't make much sense, here are a few videos on the subject</p>

                <h3> git pull "termenology"</h3>
                <p> I told myself I would only make that joke once in this guide - lets see if I hold to that.
                Before we get too far into this, we need to go over a few basic terms, and what they mean</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Respository - A collection of files and directories you are monitoring for changes using a version control tool. Sometimes shortened to repo.</li>
                  <li>Hash - A string of characters that acts like a digital fingerprint for a file or portion of a file. The type of hash used by git is the SHA1 cryptographic hash.</li>
                  <li>Graph - A diagram of nodes connected by lines called edges. </li>
                  <li>DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph. A graph were the edges are arrows (directed) and no matter which arrow you follow you can never travel in a circle (acyclic).</li>
                  <li>CLI - Command Line Interface. The “Terminal” or “Shell” of your operating system. Git is a CLI tool but there are also graphical (GUI) interfaces.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Initializing a Local Respository</h3>
                <br>
                <p>In order to get started, you need to be working in a Respository that has been "initialized". In order to initialize a respository, just type</p>
                <p>git init</p>
                <br>
                <p>after which, you can check the status of the repo for changes, or additions, at any point with
                <p>git status<p>
                <br>
                <p>and you can compare the differences between the current files and the last commit with</p>
                <p>git diff</p>

                <h3>Adding a remote origin</h3>
                <p>When you think of Git, you probably think of Github - a site to store your respository so you can pull them down on
                different machines to work on them (also, as a secure backup - trust me, you dont want a hard drive failure ruining your final project)
                In order to set up your local repository with a remote one (AKA, on GitHub), you then need to do the following</p>
                <p>To save your git repository to your GitHub account, create a new repository by way of the “create a new repo” button in the top corner of the GitHub website.
                IMPORTANT: Be sure not to click the checkbox to add an initial README file.</p>
                <p>Let’s say you’ve created a new repo called “rails_project” and you’ve already initialized this project’s git repository.
                From the command line (within your project folder) add Github as a remote:</p>
                <p>git remote add origin git@github.com:[username]/rails_project.git</p>
                <p> note - This should be all one line with [username] replaced by your actual username.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When ever you want to push the latest state of your repo to Github:</p>
                <p>git push origin [branch-name]</p>
                <p>where the branch name is the branch that you have changes on</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you create a new repo on github, it will also show you the steps of how to connect that with an initialized repository on your
                local machine<p>
              </div>

              <div>
              <h3>Let's Branch off from that topic for a second</h3>
              <p>Branches in git give you a safe space to work on new features. The main branch of your repository is called the master branch, although that is being updated to main</p>
              <br>
              <p>Commits made in other branches can be merged into the master/main at any time. Branches can also be abandoned or even deleted at any time leaving the master unchanged.
              </div>
              <p>What this means is that when developing a new feature, you can create a branch to work on. If the feature goes sideways in a big way, you can just abandon that branch and
              go back to your last stable main branch to start over without having to untangle whatever changes you may have made on that branch.</p>
              <h4>Let's go over those commands</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>To create a new branch: git checkout -b new-branch-name</li>
                <li>To switch branch: git checkout name-of-branch</li>
                <li>To merge change into the active branch: git merge branch-to-merge</li>
                <li>To delete a branch: git branch -d branch-to-delete</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you have the repo already set up to work with a remote repository, I tend to "git push origin [branch-name]" and in the console output after that command
              there will be a link to open a Pull Request. From the <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">Github Documentation</a> "Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub.
              When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.
              Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red."
              I use that pull request as another chance to go over what I have changed and catch any last minute errors</p>
              </div>

                        New Student Orientations for new ACE students take place twice a year at EDC. The goal of orientations is to get students aquainted with their new surroundings and prepare them for what lies ahead. Current students are in a fantastic position to help out because they know and understand what it's like to be an ACE student. It also provides new people who may be nervous with a friendly face to make their first little while at school easier.
